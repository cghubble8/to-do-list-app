This is a simple app I created to teach myself a little bit about swift and app development on Xcode.
The app allows the user to create tasks to be done and check them off. 
The intended functionality was to link the app to the Iphones screentime setting allowing for certain apps like social medias to be locked until all task are completed. 
At this time there is not a screen time API that i could find and that is beyond my current level of swift knowledge. This app will be revisted.
